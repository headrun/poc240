MUMBAI/HYDERABAD: The Nirav
Modi flagship store at Kalaghoda
in Mumbai is a cheerless unit. A
watchman’s uniform, a pair of
dark blue denims and a blue shirt
are slung on hangers under the
brass nameplate at its entrance.
Three bored-looking watch-
men squat on the front porch of
the store which has been shutt-
tered since February 15, under
section 281B of the Income-Tax
Act, 1961. Once known for the
sparkle of their jewellery,
upscale stores owned by Nirav
Modi and Gitanjali Gems in cities
across India wear a desolate look,
battered by $11,400-crore fraud at
Punjab National Bank, in which
Modi and Gitanjali owner are the
main suspects.
In Thane’s Viviana Mall, a
white facade has been erected in
front of Gitanjali Gems-owned
Gili store. That’s what malls do
when there is renovation work or
change of ownership taking
place, said a spokesperson for the
mall. Modi’s boutique store on
Lavelle road, Bengaluru, also
wears a forlorn look. And the
story gets worse for some of
Gitanjali Gems Ltd’s franchisees,
who say their financial problems
have persisted for years.
The Gitanjali franchise on
Cunningham Road in Bengaluru
- a desolate establishment the
middle of the busy business dis-
trict - has cut its staff from
around 10 in 2015 to three, as per a
store manager who did not wish
to be named. The three have not
been paid for the last three
months. The franchise has some
$80lakh in dues which Gitanjali
has not paid since 2015, said the
store manager.
Enforcement Directorate offi-
cials raided the store on Monday
evening, and conducted a search
that lasted until 4am on Tuesday,
according to the store manager.
The store manager refused to
give details of the franchise
owner, saying they are told notto
share his contact details with the
media. Mint couldn‘t independ-
ently reach out to him for a com-
ment.
A franchise owner from Nag-
pur closed his store in February
2017-after seven years of doing
business- because of irregular
supplies, said the store owner,
requesting anonymity. “The first
three years were good. But as
they (Gitanjali Gems) started
expanding and diversifying, the
service levels dropped and we
decided to give up the franchise, ”
said the franchise owner, who
thinks it’s better to write off the
close to $60 lakh owed by the com-
pany as it “is futile” to chase the
company for payments.
Executives at a Gitanjali show-
room in the national capital said
the business has been down ever
since news of the fraud broke. At
present, there are only three
standalone showrooms of the
company in Delhi that are still
open; although several Gitanjali
showrooms have been closed by
the company over the last few
years, according to the execu-
tives, who did not want to be
named. “There is an impact on
customer walk-ins as well as on
the overall image of the brand,”
said one ofthe franchise owners
in Delhi, asking not to be named.
Across India, close to 100 fran-
chise owners for Gitanjali have
shuttered their stores in the last
2-3 years on account of irregular
supplies from the firm, according
to another franchise owner from
Nagpur. Close to a dozen have
filed police complaints in the last
2-3 years, said a former franchise
owner, who did not want to be
named. According to this fran-
chise owner, there have been
many complaints made with dif-
ferent authorities, including the
Registrar of Companies, capital
market regulator Securities and
Exchange Board of India and
even the Prime Minister’s Office,
but these have fallen on deafears.
The repercussions though are
much wider than individual
stores. The entire gems and jewel-
lery trade has been hit. “Today
when I went for my morning
walk, aperson pointed at me and
sneered ‘you are a jeweller
right?‘," said a jeweller, who did
not wish to be identified, from
Zaveri Bazaar, Mumbai.

BEIJING:It seemed business
as usual at the Nirav Modi
boutique diamond store at
the Peninsula Hotel in Bei-
jing on Thursday.
The shop located amid a
cluster of other luqury
brands was open for busi-
ness and the employees
were eager to cater to cus-
tomers. They claimed to be
unaware about the contro-
versy raging around Modi
in India.
None ofthe employees
seemed aware that he was
at the centre of a massive
Rs11,400-crore bank fraud
that has hit the brand and
its reputation.
“This is a Chinese com-
pany based in Beijing," said
one employee, adding that
business has been “so, so”
Reports said that most of
Modi’s stores in cities
across India had been shut
by Thursday.
Modi had opened the
store at the hotel located in
Beijing’s central business
district, the first on the Chi
nese mainland, in May 2017
as part of his plans to
expand into China.
