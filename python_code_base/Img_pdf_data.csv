"In aftermath of Modi-Choksi scam, Surat diamond industry fears erosion of trust",2018-02-23,"The Rs11,400 crore fraud at the Punjab National Bank, involving diaman- taires Nirav Modi and Mehul Choksi. has ‘attled the partici- pants ofan industry that is run on trust. While some diamond merchants in Surat. the global hub for cutting and polishing this precious stone. bemoaned the trust erosion. others claimed that they had already stopped dealing with Choksi of the Gitanjali Group. “Our word is what matters the most in this industry,"" said a top official at a big diamond house on condition of ano- nymity. He said his company had stopped dealing with Choksi‘s Gitanjali Gems about 12 years ago after the company failed to make some payments on time. The diamond busi- ness works on credit which ranges from 30-180 days and the diamonds are sold only on reference basis. Others echoed his views. “I feel that the complete pic- ture is yet to come out. Many people in the industry had stopped trading in diamonds with Gitanjali from last five to seven years due to issue of timely payments."" said Babu- bhai M. Gujarati. president of Surat Diamond Association. Surat is the hub for diamond cutting and polishing and about 90% of the world‘s rough diamonds are processed here. All the big diamond houses have facilities here and trading in India is usually done through their Mumbai offices. According to estimates by Surat Diamond Association. imported rough diamonds worth Rs1 trillion came to Surat in 2016-17. ""Gitanjali has been a sight- holder for De Beers‘ Global Sightholder Sales in the past for buying, rough diamonds I don‘t know the current status but Choksi‘s business has been more of synthetic diamonds that are very popular in the US."" said Gujarati. Another diamond baron in Surat who also spoke on condi- tion of anonymity said his ANIRUDDHA CHOWDHURY MINT The diamond business works on credit which ranges from 30-180 days and the diamonds are sold only on reference basis. company had supplied Modi with diamonds a few years ago but had taken advance pay- ment. He had also experienced payments issue with Choksi in the past and said the general perception in the industry was that the duo was looking for quick fame and money. ""Butl don't think that we or anyone else had an idea that they would do such a big fraud."" the offical at the second diamond house added. An email and a text message sent to Choksi were not answered as ofpress time. “The sad part is this will impact trust in the diamond market. There will be tight ened norms. and dealing will get dill‘icult not only with the financial markets but also even within the diamond market.“ said Ashit V. Mehta. chief exec- utive officer of Arjav Dia- monds (India) Pvt. Ltd. The fear runs deep. ""There is zero impact on the diamond industry as ofnow. Also. so far. no diamond baron or diamond company has come forward and claimed that Modi and Choksi have duped them.“ said Dinesh Navadiya. former president of Surat Diamond Association and promoter ofTiku Gems. a medium-scale diamond firm. ""But what I fear is that bank loans. especially for small dia- mond businesses. will become extremely difficult. Already. banks have not been very keen in giving loans to small dia- mond merchants and nowthis (has happened). My own loan was rejected in 2009 by a nationalized bank sayingthat they don’t give loans to dia- mond companies."" he added. According'to Navadiya. the whole episode could have been prevented had the gov- ernment taken action against Winsome Diamonds a few years ago. “ I had filed an RTI (Right to Information Act) asking the Reserve Bank of lndia (RBI) to explain why and how such a large loan was given to Win- some. I got a reply saying that they do not have this informa- tion."" said Navadiya. Winsome Diamonds and Jewellery Ltd was declared a wilful defaulter and owes Rs4,680.04 crore to a consor- tium of lenders led by Stan- dard Chartered Bank.",Print_5.pdf

"Gitanjali, Nirav Modi stores wear desolate look, staff wait for dues",2018-02-23,"The Nirav Modi flagship store at Kalaghoda in Mumbai is a cheerless unit. A watchman’s uniform, a pair of dark blue denims and a blue shirt are slung on hangers under the brass nameplate at its entrance. Three bored-looking watch- men squat on the front porch of the store which has been shutt- tered since February 15, under section 281B of the Income-Tax Act, 1961. Once known for the sparkle of their jewellery, upscale stores owned by Nirav Modi and Gitanjali Gems in cities across India wear a desolate look, battered by $11,400-crore fraud at Punjab National Bank, in which Modi and Gitanjali owner are the main suspects. In Thane’s Viviana Mall, a white facade has been erected in front of Gitanjali Gems-owned Gili store. That’s what malls do when there is renovation work or change of ownership taking place, said a spokesperson for the mall. Modi’s boutique store on Lavelle road, Bengaluru, also wears a forlorn look. And the story gets worse for some of Gitanjali Gems Ltd’s franchisees, who say their financial problems have persisted for years. The Gitanjali franchise on Cunningham Road in Bengaluru - a desolate establishment the middle of the busy business dis- trict - has cut its staff from around 10 in 2015 to three, as per a store manager who did not wish to be named. The three have not been paid for the last three months. The franchise has some $80lakh in dues which Gitanjali has not paid since 2015, said the store manager. Enforcement Directorate offi- cials raided the store on Monday evening, and conducted a search that lasted until 4am on Tuesday, according to the store manager. The store manager refused to give details of the franchise owner, saying they are told notto share his contact details with the media. Mint couldn‘t independ- ently reach out to him for a com- ment. A franchise owner from Nag- pur closed his store in February 2017-after seven years of doing business- because of irregular supplies, said the store owner, requesting anonymity. “The first three years were good. But as they (Gitanjali Gems) started expanding and diversifying, the service levels dropped and we decided to give up the franchise, ” said the franchise owner, who thinks it’s better to write off the close to $60 lakh owed by the com- pany as it “is futile” to chase the company for payments. Executives at a Gitanjali show- room in the national capital said the business has been down ever since news of the fraud broke. At present, there are only three standalone showrooms of the company in Delhi that are still open; although several Gitanjali showrooms have been closed by the company over the last few years, according to the execu- tives, who did not want to be named. “There is an impact on customer walk-ins as well as on the overall image of the brand,” said one ofthe franchise owners in Delhi, asking not to be named. Across India, close to 100 fran- chise owners for Gitanjali have shuttered their stores in the last 2-3 years on account of irregular supplies from the firm, according to another franchise owner from Nagpur. Close to a dozen have filed police complaints in the last 2-3 years, said a former franchise owner, who did not want to be named. According to this fran- chise owner, there have been many complaints made with dif- ferent authorities, including the Registrar of Companies, capital market regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India and even the Prime Minister’s Office, but these have fallen on deafears. The repercussions though are much wider than individual stores. The entire gems and jewel- lery trade has been hit. “Today when I went for my morning walk, aperson pointed at me and sneered ‘you are a jeweller right?‘,"" said a jeweller, who did not wish to be identified, from Zaveri Bazaar, Mumbai. - Nirav Modi's boutique diamond store in Beijing BUSINESS AS USUAL AT MODI DIAMOND STORE IN BEIJING Sutirotho Patranobis feedback@livemint.com BEIJING:It seemed business as usual at the Nirav Modi boutique diamond store at the Peninsula Hotel in Bei- jing on Thursday. The shop located amid a cluster of other luqury brands was open for busi- ness and the employees were eager to cater to cus- tomers.

Aggressive PNB accuses Nirav of money laundering,2018-02-23,"Punjab National Bank (PNB) went on the offensive on Thurs- day and accused jew- eller Nirav Modi of money laundering and Violat- ing foreign exchange regula- tions. The bank has also asked Modi, accused in a $1.8 billion fraud case, to come up with a concrete repayment plan. The beleaguered bank, fighting off charges of negli- gence and criminal conspiracy by some staffers, has also, for the first time, hit back at Modi. Investigative agencies are probing the scam in which bank officials are accused of colluding with group firms of Modi and Mehul Choksi to fraudulently issue letters of undertaking (LoUs), or guar- antees, which were then used by the firms to borrow from overseas branches of other banks. Further, it was found that the amounts borrowed were PNB MD & CEO Sunil Mehta not used to meet the import payments but were diverted. PNB’s Thursday communi- que was in response to a letter written by Modi on Monday in which he had accused the bank of jeopardizing his ability to repay dues. “You were getting LoUs issued illegally and in an unau- thorized way through few bank officials. At no stage such facilities were extended by our bank to the three partner firms. When these illegal activ- ities surfaced, they pointed out towards apparent violation of Fema and money laundering,"" said the letter written by gen- eral manager Ashwini Vats. “As required by law, the bank was compelled to bring these activities to the notice of law and enforcement agen’ cies,” the letter added. The letter also rejected the repayment plan presented by Modi, saying it was not backed by upfront amounts and time- lines. “However. should you have any concrete and imple- mentable plan, do revelt,” the letter said. Modi, in his letter to the bank, said that the money he owed banks was less than Rs5,000 crore and not what was publicized. He also blamed PNB of destroying his brand and business and clos- ing all options for a possible repayment of dues in its “anxi- ety to recover dues immedi- ately"". Modi had proposed that he be given time to sell his flag- ship company Firestar Group or its assets to repay the dues not only of F irestar Group. but also of the three firms-Dia- monds R Us, Solar Exports and Stellar Diamonds-named in the Central Bureau of Investi- gation (CBI) complaint. He had pegged the valua- tion of the business at Rs6,500 crore and claimed that this “could have helped reduce,"" discharge the debt to the banking system"". He blamed PNB's erroneous reporting for seizure of the operations. leading to these firms‘ closure. Emails sent to representa- tives of the Modi group bounced back. Modi’s lawyer could not be contacted. Last week. in a press confer- ence, PNB managing director and chief executive Sunil Mehta had dismissed the ear- lier repayment plans offered by Modi as vague. Investigation agencies con- tinued their searches on Thursday, with the Enforce- ment Directorate seizing nine luqury cars belonging to Modi and Choksi. The agency also froze mutual funds and shares worth Rs94.5 crore belonging to the. Nirav Modi group and Choksi's Gitanjali Gems.",Print_4.pdf
"So, how did they ponzi it?",2018-02-23,"EVER SINCE THE Punjab National Bank(PNB) scam broke, we have been treated to a stream ofincredulous pieces of information. Here's a sample. First, that the mama-bhanja duo of Me- hul Choksi and Nirav Modi used the services ofa deputy manager, Gokulnath Shetty, and some other crooked junior employees of PNB's Brady House branch in Fort Mumbai, allegedly operating by themselves from little cubby holes, to defraud the bank of Rs 11,397 crore.Second. Shetty repeatedly issued fraud banking instruments called Letters of Undertaking (LoU) in favour of Modi's and Choksi's firms,which allowed correspondent Indian bank branches abroad to pay for their diamond imports. Third, contrary to all rota- tional practices, Shetty remained at the same critical post for seven years. That's notall. Fourth, most of these LoU- based transactions occurred outside PNB's core banking system (CBS), which tracks every debit and credit forall PNB accounts across the globe and reconciles these on a daily basis. Fifth, none ofthe correspondent bank branches abroad appear to have offi- cially acknowledged PNB’s LoUs that they were honouring. And if they did, these doc- uments disappeared in some Brady House rabbit warren. Sixth neither PNB nor the cor- respondent banks ever smelt a rat. This is strange Diamond trade financing is a dicey business - with PNB itself having earlier suf- fered a large scandal involving Winsome Diamonds, whose promoter. Jatin Mehta, es- caped to becomea citizen ofabalmyand eth- ical Caribbean island called St Kitts and Nevis. And, last of all, the fraud came to light af- ter Shetty had retired. A foolish man from a Modi firm went to Shetty's successor to ask fora fresh LoU without any cash margin, claiming that it was never needed in thepast. No commentator can yet claim to know all the“real facts"" of this scandal. Instead, let me pose some uncomfortable questions. An LoU is a good place to start It isa per- fectly sound instrument through which a bank(PNB, Brady House), on behalf of a cus- tomer(a Modi firm),undertakes to honour a payment made by another   bank (say Allahabad Bank's branch in Hong PNB was one of the first public sector banks to implement full-fledged computerisation which included the CBS. Brady House's SWIFT system was delinked with PNB's CBS. Was this do me manually by Shetty? Or is there no link whatsoever between all PNB originating SWIFT transactions and its CBS? The former is the act of a rogue; the latter the making of a systemic catastrophe. Kong) for imports by its client.Subject to an LoU's financial limits, the overseas bank of- fers short term buyer's credit to the importer, usually for 30 to 90 days. For any LoU, the is- suing bank earns a fee: the overseas bank earns interest which is LIBOR plus a spread; and the importer accesses significantly cheaper overseas credit. No problems up to here. Now start the uncomfortable questions Why were these LoUs repeatedly issued without any margin money? Moreover, any LoU sent to an overseas bank is automatically acknowledged. How could these acknowl- edgements disappear? Now to SWIFT. Globally, inter-bank in- structions for financial transactions are trans- mitted through SWIFT, a messaging system that requires a clear setof codes.Any SWIFT message must be vetted by three different people in the sending bank: A maker who keys in the message, a checkerand a verifier - the last doing the transmitting after being satisfied that everything is in order. How could Shetty blithely use other people's lo- gin identities and passwords for seven long years to show that these SWIFT messages in- volving increasingly larger amounts were ex- ecuted as prescribed? PNB was one of the first public sector ba- nks to implement full-fledged computerisa- tion which included the CBS. Brady House's SWIFTsystem was delinked with PN B's CBS. Was this done manually by Shetty? Or is there no link whatsoever between all PNB originating SWIFT trans actions and its CBS? The former is the act ofa rogue; thelatter the making of a systemic catastrophe. On to nostro accounts. Italian for ""ours"", nostro signifies “our bank's money held in another bank"". When an overseas SWIFT transaction occurs, the   for- eign currency amount is put into a nostro ac- count,which is automatically acknowledged by the overseas bank The counterpart over- seas bank is supposed to send a SWIFT mes- sage confirming the amount in the nostroac- count How can PNB, Brady House, have no records of these nostros? After the overseas bank offered buyer's credit to pay the supplier abroad for the sparklers imported by Nirav Modi, it should have debited the   amount from the nostro account, and informed PNB, Brady House, ofthe final position against the   LoU, Where are these docu- ments? Why were these not eventually re- flected in PNB's CBS? If Nirav Modi paid in full on the duedate against every LoU issued, there would be no fraud. He didn't. Because he was expanding his business too fast,and needed more and more gems, without enough cash for these. So,Shetty obligingly created even larger LoUs with no margin money. used SWIFT. circum- vented CBS, which were then presented to the banks abroad for even more buyer's credit to purchase the next consignment of sparklers and pearls. Over the years, each of the overseas bank branches was presented larger and larger PNB- originated LoUs.What were theoverseas man- agers smoking? How come no one thought something was amiss and kept e*tending more buyer's credit without any serious cross- checking? What about “abundant caution , a term reverentially used by bankers? Next, who did the internal audits, branch audits, concurrent audits and statutory au- dits? What kind ofaudits were these with some Rs 11,400 crore slipping through the cracks? Were PNB's board of directors and audit committee sleeping on the watch?And why were these accounts not reconciled and squared up over seven years? Now to the regulator. What about the RBI’s audits -especially since the regulator is keen on keeping close tabs on large value nos tro accounts? Finally, given its past record,with the CBI taking over, should we at all expect to reach any sensible resolution? Throughout this scam, one inescapable fact stares us in the face. The public sector banking system has become rotten to the core, and such banks are ripe for easy gam- ing. But who cares, really?",Print_2.jpg
