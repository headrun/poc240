NEW DELHI
Punjab National Bank
(PNB) went on the
offensive on Thurs-
day and accused jew-
eller Nirav Modi of
money laundering and Violat-
ing foreign exchange regula-
tions.
The bank has also asked
Modi, accused in a $1.8 billion
fraud case, to come up with a
concrete repayment plan.
The beleaguered bank,
fighting off charges of negli-
gence and criminal conspiracy
by some staffers, has also, for
the first time, hit back at Modi.
Investigative agencies are
probing the scam in which
bank officials are accused of
colluding with group firms of
Modi and Mehul Choksi to
fraudulently issue letters of
undertaking (LoUs), or guar-
antees, which were then used
by the firms to borrow from
overseas branches of other
banks.
Further, it was found that
the amounts borrowed were
PNB MD & CEO Sunil Mehta
not used to meet the import
payments but were diverted.
PNB’s Thursday communi-
que was in response to a letter
written by Modi on Monday in
which he had accused the
bank of jeopardizing his ability
to repay dues.
“You were getting LoUs
issued illegally and in an unau-
thorized way through few
bank officials. At no stage such
facilities were extended by our
bank to the three partner
firms. When these illegal activ-
ities surfaced, they pointed out
towards apparent violation of
Fema and money laundering,"
said the letter written by gen-
eral manager Ashwini Vats.
“As required by law, the
bank was compelled to bring
these activities to the notice of
law and enforcement agen’
cies,” the letter added.
The letter also rejected the
repayment plan presented by
Modi, saying it was not backed
by upfront amounts and time-
lines. “However. should you
have any concrete and imple-
mentable plan, do revelt,” the
letter said.
Modi, in his letter to the
bank, said that the money he
owed banks was less than
Rs5,000 crore and not what
was publicized. He also
blamed PNB of destroying his
brand and business and clos-
ing all options for a possible
repayment of dues in its “anxi-
ety to recover dues immedi-
ately".
Modi had proposed that he
be given time to sell his flag-
ship company Firestar Group
or its assets to repay the dues
not only of F irestar Group. but
also of the three firms-Dia-
monds R Us, Solar Exports and
Stellar Diamonds-named in
the Central Bureau of Investi-
gation (CBI) complaint.
He had pegged the valua-
tion of the business at Rs6,500
crore and claimed that this
“could have helped reduce,"
discharge the debt to the
banking system".
He blamed PNB's erroneous
reporting for seizure of the
operations. leading to these
firms‘ closure.
Emails sent to representa-
tives of the Modi group
bounced back. Modi’s lawyer
could not be contacted.
Last week. in a press confer-
ence, PNB managing director
and chief executive Sunil
Mehta had dismissed the ear-
lier repayment plans offered
by Modi as vague.
Investigation agencies con-
tinued their searches on
Thursday, with the Enforce-
ment Directorate seizing nine
luqury cars belonging to Modi
and Choksi. The agency also
froze mutual funds and shares
worth Rs94.5 crore belonging
to the. Nirav Modi group and
Choksi's Gitanjali Gems.
