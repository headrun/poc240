diamond industry fears erosion of trust

SURAT/MUMBAI
The Rs11,400 crore fraud
at the Punjab National
Bank, involving diaman-
taires Nirav Modi and Mehul
Choksi. has ‘attled the partici-
pants ofan industry that is run
on trust. While some diamond
merchants in Surat. the global
hub for cutting and polishing
this precious stone. bemoaned
the trust erosion. others
claimed that they had already
stopped dealing with Choksi of
the Gitanjali Group.
“Our word is what matters
the most in this industry," said
a top official at a big diamond
house on condition of ano-
nymity. He said his company
had stopped dealing with
Choksi‘s Gitanjali Gems about
12 years ago after the company
failed to make some payments
on time. The diamond busi-
ness works on credit which
ranges from 30-180 days and
the diamonds are sold only on
reference basis.
Others echoed his views.
“I feel that the complete pic-
ture is yet to come out. Many
people in the industry had
stopped trading in diamonds
with Gitanjali from last five to
seven years due to issue of
timely payments." said Babu-
bhai M. Gujarati. president of
Surat Diamond Association.
Surat is the hub for diamond
cutting and polishing and
about 90% of the world‘s
rough diamonds are processed
here. All the big diamond
houses have facilities here and
trading in India is usually done
through their Mumbai offices.
According to estimates by
Surat Diamond Association.
imported rough diamonds
worth Rs1 trillion came to
Surat in 2016-17.
"Gitanjali has been a sight-
holder for De Beers‘ Global
Sightholder Sales in the past
for buying, rough diamonds I
don‘t know the current status
but Choksi‘s business has been
more of synthetic diamonds
that are very popular in the
US." said Gujarati.
Another diamond baron in
Surat who also spoke on condi-
tion of anonymity said his

company had supplied Modi
with diamonds a few years ago
but had taken advance pay-
ment. He had also experienced
payments issue with Choksi in
the past and said the general
perception in the industry was
that the duo was looking for
quick fame and money. "Butl
don't think that we or anyone
else had an idea that they
would do such a big fraud." the
offical at the second diamond
house added.
An email and a text message
sent to Choksi were not
answered as ofpress time.
“The sad part is this will
impact trust in the diamond
market. There will be tight
ened norms. and dealing will
get dill‘icult not only with the
financial markets but also even
within the diamond market.“
said Ashit V. Mehta. chief exec-
utive officer of Arjav Dia-
monds (India) Pvt. Ltd.
The fear runs deep.
"There is zero impact on the
diamond industry as ofnow.
Also. so far. no diamond baron
or diamond company has
come forward and claimed
that Modi and Choksi have
duped them.“ said Dinesh
Navadiya. former president of
Surat Diamond Association
and promoter ofTiku Gems. a
medium-scale diamond firm.
"But what I fear is that bank
loans. especially for small dia-
mond businesses. will become
extremely difficult. Already.
banks have not been very keen
in giving loans to small dia-
mond merchants and nowthis
(has happened). My own loan
was rejected in 2009 by a
nationalized bank sayingthat
they don’t give loans to dia-
mond companies." he added.
According'to Navadiya. the
whole episode could have
been prevented had the gov-
ernment taken action against
Winsome Diamonds a few
years ago.
“ I had filed an RTI (Right to
Information Act) asking the
Reserve Bank of lndia (RBI) to
explain why and how such a
large loan was given to Win-
some. I got a reply saying that
they do not have this informa-
tion." said Navadiya.
Winsome Diamonds and
Jewellery Ltd was declared a
wilful defaulter and owes
Rs4,680.04 crore to a consor-
tium of lenders led by Stan-
dard Chartered Bank.
